                    <h3>What is an Akiya?</h3>
                    <p>An akiya, simply put, is an abandoned or vacant house. These properties are typically older homes
                        left unoccupied for various reasons, including financial difficulties, inheritance issues, or
                        demographic shifts. They can range from traditional wooden houses in rural areas to modern
                        apartments in urban centers. In recent years, the term "akiya" has gained prominence as an
                        intriguing option for those looking to purchase property in Japan.

                    <h3>Why Does Japan Have So Many Empty Houses?</h3>
                    <p>Japan's high number of akiya can be attributed to a combination of demographic, economic, and
                        cultural factors.

                            Japan is facing an aging population, with fewer young people to occupy homes. Many elderly
                            homeowners have passed away or moved to care facilities, leaving their houses vacant.

                            Rural areas have been hit the hardest, as younger generations gravitate towards urban

                            Complex inheritance laws in Japan can make it challenging to transfer property within

                        expensive akiya or lived in house that is in better condition and requires less work than it
                        would be to buy a cheap one requiring extensive work.

                            Assess the condition of the akiya and budget for necessary repairs or renovations. We can
                            help connect you to local building companies. The cost to repair is often more than what you
                            purchase the property for.

                        neighbors.
