                    <h3>Description & history</h3>
                    <p>
                        18 rooms. 2 are western style with double beds the other 16 are
                        traditional Japanese tatami rooms. All rooms are very clean and
                        require minimal work. The japanese rooms vary in style from
                        regular style rooms to larger rooms and higher end rooms.
                        <span class="highlight bold">Most rooms have their own toilet and some rooms also have their own
                            shower/bath.</span>
                        <br /><br />
                        There is a large tatami (enkai) party room that served
                        as a dining area for large parties and also for serving dinner to
                        guests at the hotel each evening. <br /><br />There is a
                        bar/karaoke area with its own entrance/exit to the hotel. A
                        conference room that was also used for serving breakfast and
                        dinner. A beautiful traditional style small restaurant area on the
                        first floor. Large kitchen with elevator on the first floor and
                        smaller kitchens on each floor.<br /><br />
                        The hotel also has an elevator for guest use. House area in the
                        basement with four rooms where the family could live. Also two
                        other smaller rooms in the basement that could be used for staff.
                        Two large onsen on the first floor. These could be filled with
                        either onsen water or regular water heated by the boiler.<br /><br />
                        The hotel was built and run by my family who are still in the
                        local area. They can tell you about every detail you wish to know
                        and also about the general running of the hotel.

                    <p>
                        It hasn’t operated for a few years and needs some repair work on
                        the outside walls. The boiler would probably also need some repair
                        work I think.
                        <br /><br />
                        As a newer built hotel its a solid steel structure that is well
                        laid out and won’t require much work with inside renovations.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span class="highlight bold">The inside of the hotel is very clean</span> and needs minimal
                        work.
                        The
                        kitchen is fitted with new ovens, dishwasher and other appliances,
                        all ready for use.

                    <h3>Additional costs</h3>
                    <p>
                        The following will be additional costs on top of the purchase
                        price, but may be negotiable.
                    </p>
                    <ol class="blog-ol">

                                <p class="bold">Leased Land</p>
                            </div>
                            The hotel is on leased land which is fairly common in Japan. If
                            this concept is a stumbling block for you please feel free to
                            get in touch to talk about it as it isn't a major issue. The
                            land requires a deposit of 2.4million yen (maybe negotiable).
                            This is returned should you ever sell the property. There is
                            then a monthly fee of 41,000 yen.
                        </li>

                            </div>
                            The hotel comes with 5 onsen pipes. You can operate the onsen
                            with 3 pipes and heat the water with the boiler. You can also
                            choose to not use the onsen pipes at all and just use regular
                            heated water in the baths.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div class="highlight-box">

                            </div>
                            For 5 pipes there is a negotiable one time payment of 8.2
                            million yen. There is then a monthly fee of 93,000 yen. For 3
                            pipes the cost would be 4.95 million as a one off payment and
                            56,000 per month. These costs may be negotiable.
                        </li>

                            </div>
                            You can also negate all these costs by opting to not use the
                            onsen pipes. The baths can be filled with regular water and
                            heated by the boiler.

                    <p>
                        The hotel was operated year round in past and catered to both
                        domestic and foreign guests. As the owner of the property you
                        could either opt for a winter only operation or a year round open
                        operation and also cater to Japanese customers. If you need a
                        manager for the property then the myself and the original owners
                        are more than willing to help.
